# Push to GitHub Instructions

Your project is now ready to be pushed to GitHub! Your API key has been secured and will not be committed.

## What Was Done

‚úÖ **API Key Secured:**
- Moved API key from `Constants.java` to `local.properties`
- Updated `build.gradle.kts` to inject API key from `local.properties` into `BuildConfig`
- Updated `Constants.java` to read from `BuildConfig.NEWS_API_KEY`

‚úÖ **Git Configuration:**
- Initialized git repository
- Updated `.gitignore` with comprehensive Android patterns
- Created `local.properties.example` template for other developers
- Created initial commit (89 files)

‚úÖ **Documentation:**
- Created `GITHUB_SETUP.md` with setup instructions for other developers
- `local.properties` is gitignored and will NOT be pushed to GitHub

## Next Steps to Push to GitHub

### 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Enter a repository name (e.g., `bigmanting` or `swipe-news-app`)
3. Choose public or private
4. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Your Code

After creating the repository, run these commands:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace with your actual URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify Security

After pushing, verify on GitHub that:
- ‚úÖ `local.properties` is **NOT** visible in the repository
- ‚úÖ `local.properties.example` **IS** visible
- ‚úÖ `Constants.java` does **NOT** contain your actual API key
- ‚úÖ `.gitignore` is present

## For Other Developers Cloning Your Repo

They will need to:
1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `local.properties.example` to `local.properties`
3. Add their own NewsAPI key to `local.properties`
4. Add their own `google-services.json` from Firebase

See `GITHUB_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.

## Important Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Never commit these files:**
- `local.properties` - Contains API keys
- `google-services.json` - Contains Firebase credentials (if using production)
- Any `.keystore` or `.jks` files - Contains signing keys

‚úÖ **Safe to commit:**
- `local.properties.example` - Template file
- All source code files
- Resource files
- Build configuration files

## Troubleshooting

**If you accidentally committed sensitive data:**
1. Remove it from git history using `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner
2. Rotate/regenerate the exposed API keys immediately
3. Force push the cleaned repository

**If the build fails after cloning:**
- Ensure `local.properties` exists with valid API key
- Run `./gradlew clean build` to rebuild
