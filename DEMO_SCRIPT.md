## Q&A Preparation

### Potential Questions:

**Q: Why Firebase instead of SQLite?**
**A:** "Firebase Firestore provides built-in cloud sync, offline persistence, real-time updates, and eliminates server setup. It offers the same local caching as SQLite but with automatic cloud backup and multi-device sync."

**Q: How does offline mode work?**
**A:** "Firestore's offline persistence automatically caches all read data locally. When offline, queries are served from the cache. When online, writes are synced automatically. I enabled this in the Application class with `setPersistenceEnabled(true)`."

**Q: What happens if the user runs out of articles?**
**A:** "The app shows an empty view with a message. Users can refresh or switch categories to load more articles. In production, we could implement pagination to load more articles from NewsAPI."

**Q: How are Firestore security rules implemented?**
**A:** "I've configured rules so users can only read/write documents under `users/{uid}/saved_articles`. This ensures complete data isolation between users."

**Q: Can this app be extended?**
**A:** "Absolutely! Possible extensions include:
- Location-based trending news
- Push notifications for breaking news
- Search functionality
- User preferences for sources
- Article bookmarking with categories"

**Q: How did you handle NewsAPI's rate limits?**
**A:** "The free tier provides 100 requests/day, which is sufficient for testing. For production, users can upgrade or implement caching strategies. The app also allows users to enter their own API key in Settings."
